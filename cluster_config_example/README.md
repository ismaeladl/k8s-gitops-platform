# 🛠️ Cluster Configuration Examples

This folder contains **plain Kubernetes manifests** to support production-grade workloads:

- Namespace
- ResourceQuota
- LimitRange
- NetworkPolicy
- PodDisruptionBudget (PDB)

⚡ Purpose: Demonstrate **namespace-scoped-level** best practices for resource control, security, and high availability.

## Note

This folder does not include every possible manifest. The goal here is to provide **cluster-level support for the demo production-like workload** templated by Helm in **`Helm/`**, without overwhelming with unnecessary resources.
